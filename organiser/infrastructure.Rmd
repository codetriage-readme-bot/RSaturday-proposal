# Infrastructure
Setting up a confernece is tough - you have to do sponsorship, marketing, logistics, speaker selection, and on top of that all you usually have to build or piecce together the systems to support it all.

For satRday's we're looking to simplify the process and provide:

 - A central site that gives:
   + registration capabilities
   + a way of receiving sessions for consideration
   + an agenda building capabilities
 - A brand that:
   + works out of the box
   + gives a logo that can be tweaked to suit your event
   + makes calls for speakers etc easier
 - Central mentors, who have run conferences in the past
