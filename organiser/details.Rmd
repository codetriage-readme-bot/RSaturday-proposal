# Event details
This is an evolving list, but here are some things that we think you should do or think about, regarding your event.

## Talking to us
Before you start the ball rolling on your satRday, drop us line. Most of us helping out centrally have run conferences before, so we'll do some things like:

- help you set a date that optimises attendance
- help point you in the direction of sponsors
- be a mentor / lifeline/ shoulder to cry on / introducer

## Day
We think it should be a Saturday of course! that being said, you can extend the conference to run on the Friday and/or Sunday too and make it a weekendR.

## Content
What actually gets presented at your satRday is entirely up to you! We do however, have some recommendations designed to cater to different segments of the potential attendees:

- A workshop to help beginners get started. There is another neat ISC proposal to build one of these so that it's "pre-canned" and ready to go that any intermediate R user can give it.

## Branding
We've designed an open source brand. We do hope that your satRday will keep the essential logo, but you are absolutely encouraged to modify it to suit your needs.

## Code of conduct
Part of our commitment to the community is to be an open and inclusive community. As such, each satRday **must** have a [Code of Conduct](ConferenceCodeOfConduct.html), and have done the ground work to ensure that it can be upheld in the event of any (unlikely) issues.

## Charging
We'd like to keep the events as cheap as possible in order to make them accessible. Our guideline is that it should cost attendees no more than a console game (~$50) and that you should have a mechanism to allow people to request free attendance.
