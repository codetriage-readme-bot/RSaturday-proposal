Interested parties
------------------

We've had tremendous support from the community over the length of
developing the proposal. From the first comments on the [initial blog
post](http://itsalocke.com/sqlsaturdays-but-for-r/), to active
discussion on the
[repository](https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal), to 322
people signing up as interested parties towards the end of the proposal
development cycle. Below is a breakdown of the interested parties per
region:

A more detailed breakdown of the location of the interested parties:

We also asked how far the interested parties are willing to travel for
an satRday event:

It seems that most respondents are interested in local events, but many
(~31%) respondents are willing to travel as well.

Further great news and promising feedback from the community is that the
respondents are willing to actively take part in future events:

We already have more than 120 presenters, roughly 310 attendees and 40
webmasters -- what can go wrong?
