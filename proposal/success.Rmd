# Success
<!-- 
Projects should have a definition of done that is measurable, and a thorough understanding going in of what the risks are to delivery 
-->

## Definition of done
<!-- 
What does success look like? 
-->
This project will deliver a coherent brand for community R conferences, a central site, and three conferences.

## Measuring success
<!-- 
How will we know when success is achieved, what markers can we use along the way 
-->
Milestones for the technical sides of the project are:

  1. Informational site is live
  2. Conference site functionality is live

Milestones for each conference are:
  
  1. Location decided
  2. Budgets put together
  3. Venue confirmed
  4. Registration open
  5. Agenda published
  6. The conference!
  
## Future work
<!-- 
How could this be extended / developed in the future by yourself and/or the community in general?
-->
This infrastructure and first few events give us the potential for greatly developing the R community. It also has a lot of side benefits like being an ideal place to host beginner R labs, showcase developer work, grow the avenues for commercial partners to engage with r users and so forth.

If the events are a success then the model for onging financial support will need to determined. There are a number of (not mutually exclusive) options available:

  1. The Consortium members collectively set a budget for the satRdays and members become sponsors of individual events through this global support level - this could be a mechanism for encouraging more Consortium members if sponsorship was exclusively through the Consortium
  2. A global sponsorship platform where Consortium members and others could provide sponsorship towards all satRdays
  3. Individual events solicit their own sponsorship

## Key risks

Short term, the biggest risks to the project are the organisers of the individual events not pulling it off and the central site being not fit for purpose. Mitigants for this involve a seperation of duties so that noone is over-burdened, and involving the community where possible.

Long term, the biggest risk is a lack of sponsors to make conferences viable.  Hopefully, the R ecosystem will continue to grow and commercial partners will see the benefits of conferences, but if that doesn't happen the ability to charge up to Â£30 per attendee should be sufficient to maintain a conference so long as they budget appropriately.
