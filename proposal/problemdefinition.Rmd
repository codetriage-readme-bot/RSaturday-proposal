In 2015, we saw a bumper number of R conferences:

- UseR!, Denmark, ~£400
- EARL London, UK, ~£400
- EARL Boston, USA, ~£400
- R/Finance, USA, ~£200
- R in Insurance, Holland, ~£300
- BioC 2015, USA, [??]
- European Bioconductor Developers' Meeting 2015, UK, [??]
- [Any Others?]

Unfortunately, this is still relatively few conferences. Few are outside of the US and the UK, making the travel costs significant for users of R outside of these areas.

These costs make attending R conferences difficult, reducing the audience who can attend and limiting it to those who either have the money themselves or who belong to organisation that will pay for them to attend.

Conferences are a vital aspect of a tech community as provide a concentrated learning and networking environment. User groups have a similar effect but conferences are an order of magnitude greater due to the greater volumes of people and breadth of content.
