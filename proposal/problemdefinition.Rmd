It is important to cover:

In 2015, we saw a bumper number of R conferences:

- UseR!, Denmark, ~£400
- EARL London, UK, ~£400
- EARL Boston, USA, ~£400
- R/Finance, USA, ~£200
- R in Insurance, Holland, ~£300
- [Any Others?]

Some of these were organised by companies, others by a collection of user groups. Unfortunately, this is still relatively few conferences and the travel costs for people to attend are typically large.

The costs involved with attending these conferences makes it difficult for a wide range of people to attend. Conferences are a common way to engage both new and existing users of a technology, and ensuring that more conferences develop around R is an important step for growing the user base.
