# satRday proposal
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal)

This repository is for the development of a proposal for the R Consortium around the development of community events, and a platform to manage them. At present most of the activity is happening in the [Issues section](https://github.com/stephlocke/RSaturday-proposal/issues) as we discuss various aspects of the proposal.

You can check the outputs of this repo out at [satRdays.org](http://planning.satrdays.org)

## About
This proposal surrounds support for smaller, but more frequent conferences, that are run by user groups in an area. They allow for growth of the user base whilst making access to speakers and content much easier by bringing the content to an area.

There is an existing model in the SQL Server world, called a SQL Saturday, which is a free conference on the weekend, run by the local user group. These have a central infrastructure supported and developed by the Professional Association for SQL Server. This proposal will use these as a starting point but will develop a community event that fits the R community and where we would like to grow it.

@stephlocke outlined the idea initially in a blog [SQLSaturdays but for R?](http://itsalocke.com/sqlsaturdays-but-for-r/) and raised the idea at the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) panel at [EARL Boston](http://www.earl-conference.com/boston/agenda/) receiving initial support the idea. We now just have to decide what we want to do :-)

## Background

Community growth and support make up a significant portion of the R Consortium goals. They're here to help us build the community, so let's build the community!
