This repository is for the development of a proposal for the R Consortium around the development of community events, and a platform to manage them.

## Background 
Set up in 2015, the R Consortium is an organisation set up to help support the R Foundation, the R Community, and R users.

> The primary purpose of the R Consortium (collectively, the “Purpose”) is to: 
>
>(a) advance the worldwide promotion of and support for the R open source language and environment as the preferred language for statistical computing and graphics (the “Environment”);
>
>(b) establish, maintain, seek support for, and develop infrastructure projects and technical and infrastructure collaboration initiatives related to the Environment, and such other initiatives as may be appropriate to support, enable and promote the Environment; 
>
>(c) encourage and increase user adoption, involvement with, and contribution to, the Environment; 
>
>(d) facilitate communication and collaboration among users and developers of the Environment, the R Consortium and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing (the “R Foundation”); 
>
>(e) support and maintain policies set by the Board; and 
>
>(f) undertake such other activities as may from time to time be appropriate to further the purposes and achieve the goals set forth above.  
>
>In furtherance of these efforts, the R Consortium shall seek to solicit the participation of all interested parties on a fair, equitable and open basis.

Community growth and support make up the initial three goals of the R Consortium. As people within the R community, this proposal is geared around how we can mutually achhieve these goals with community events.

There is an existing model in the SQL Server world, called a SQL Saturday, which is a free conference on the weekend, run by the local user group. These have a central infrastructure supported and developed by the Professional Association for SQL Server. This proposal will use these as a starting point but will develop a community event that fits the R community and where we would like to grow it.
